- 👋 Hi, I’m IcyBits
- 👀 I’m interested in making web games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future (I'm not an expert. Gotta learn more)
- 📫 You can still reach me through my personal email: mahirahmansocial503@gmail.com
or Discord: IcyBits
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

### Note:
I am not the owner of the account named "icybits" in GitHub. My only account is "icybits-lab". We are not connected or related in any way.

Althought it would be nice to get that username for myself. I have proof that I'm using this name on various platforms since 2020... should've copyrighted my name 🙂
